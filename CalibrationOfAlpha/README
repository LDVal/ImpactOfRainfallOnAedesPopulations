Here is the code to calibrate the value of alpha, as described in the Appendix. From a terminal window execute the following:

gfortran Alpha_TableCities.f90 randgen.f

This will create an executable file called a.out. To run the program, type in the terminal

./a.out

The input file should contain the actual daily rainfall time series for one city, which
correspond to the rainiest month in that city.
