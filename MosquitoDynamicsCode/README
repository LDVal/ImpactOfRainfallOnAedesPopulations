Here is the code to compute the extinction probability as a function of alpha (Fig. 5a). F
rom a terminal window execute the following:

mpif90  MosquitoDynamics.f90

This will create an executable file called a.out. To run the program, type in the terminal:

mpirun -np 4 ./a.out

In order to compute  the extinction probability in Hualien as a function of alpha, open the file MosquitoDynamics.f90 
with a text editor, and set the value of numCity to 1. Similarly, for Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Taipei, set “numCity  =2”,
“numCity  =3”,“numCity  =4”, respectively.
