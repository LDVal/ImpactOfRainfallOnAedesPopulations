Here is the code to calibrate our mosquito population model using the Latin Hypercube
Sampling method, as described in the Supporting Information, Section B. From a terminal
window execute the following:

mpif90 LatinHypercubeSampling.f90

This will create an executable file called a.out. To run the program, type in the terminal

mpirun -np 4 ./a.out

The program generates an output called VarianceLHS.dat, which contains five columns:
the first four are the explored values of beta, k, Hmax, and Kmax. The last column
contains the sum of the square distances corresponding to all the cities.
